## Approach
The work consisted of a process of re-elaboration and re-implementation of the gan presented by https://github.com/mnicnc404/CartoonGan-tensorflow. Finally she was trained with colab on a new set of images to then observe the results.


## Documentation
You can read our final technical documentation about this project here [DOCUMENTATION](./CartoonGAN__Generative_Adversarial_Networks_for_Photo_Cartoonization.pdf)

## Results
After some problems encountered (such as enormous training time, OOM exhausted resource, network instability ...), we found good results thanks to tensorboard, shown here [RESULTS](./results.jpg)
